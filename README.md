Let's suppose we have four documents of Matlab code for checking the similarity. Doc 4 consists the matlab code for the gradient descent algorithm and other 3 docs consists of matlab code for Compute cost with slight variations. So, we can see that the doc 4 is much far away to other documents becasue the measure of similarity is least.
